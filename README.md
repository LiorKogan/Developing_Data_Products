Function and derivative grapher
===

This is an R Shiny application that let you plot a function, and its derivative at a given point.

The UI input is composed of the following elemenents:
- The function: You should input a function such as x^2, sin(x), abs(x)+sin(x), etc.
- The display range: set the display range between -10 to 10
- The value of X for which to draw the derivative line

The UI output is composed of the following elemenents:
- The value of y and the value of the derivative at the given value of x
- The graph of the function and the derivative line

When the function entered is not valid, an error message will be displayed instead of these output elements.

Enjoy!
